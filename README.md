# Gaussian linear optics with Mathematica

In this repository, we provide a Mathematica package for simulating Gaussian linear optical circuits. We also provide files for various statements from [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06838). We often use the symbolic unitary Haar integrator from https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08539 and https://github.com/MotohisaFukuda/RTNI.

- PageCurves/plots-for-paper.nb corresponds to Figure 1 in our paper.
- Variance/omega2.nb contains part of the proof of Theorem 6 in our paper. We use the symbolic Haar integrator referenced above.
- PageCurves/Conjecture10.nb contains the example referenced in the discussion following Conjecture 10 in our paper.
