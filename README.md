# Gaussian linear optics with Mathematica

In this repository, we provide a Mathematica package for simulating Gaussian linear optical circuits. We also provide files for various statements from our paper. We often use the symbolic unitary Haar integrator fromhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08539 and https://github.com/MotohisaFukuda/RTNI.
